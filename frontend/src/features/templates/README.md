## Frontend Enhancement Plan based on Provided Schema

**Objective:** Enhance the frontend of the Proxmox PaaS system to incorporate a more user-friendly and organized way to select and create virtual machines, containers, and other resources based on predefined templates. This includes improving logging and creation pages, implementing a card-based layout for templates, and adding categorized dropdown menus.

**Key Features to Implement:**

1.  **Template Categorization:**
    *   Implement a system to categorize templates based on the provided schema (Networking, Virtual Machine, Container Service, Cluster).
    *   Within each category, further sub-categorize as specified (e.g., Linux Workstation, Windows Server under Virtual Machine).

2.  **Card-Based Template Display:**
    *   Redesign the template selection interface to use a card-based layout.
    *   Each card should represent a specific template and display key information such as:
        *   Template Name/Title
        *   Brief Description
        *   Icon or representative image (if applicable)
        *   Key features/components (e.g., for a Linux Workstation: Ubuntu, Docker, Dev Tools)
        *   Use cases or suitability
    *   Cards should be visually appealing and easy to understand.

3.  **Categorized Dropdown Menu:**
    *   Implement a dropdown menu or similar filtering mechanism to allow users to easily filter templates by category and sub-category.
    *   This will help users quickly find the specific type of resource they want to create.

4.  **Enhanced Creation Forms:**
    *   When a user selects a template, the subsequent creation form should be pre-filled or customized based on the selected template.
    *   For example, selecting a "Linux Workstation" template might pre-fill OS type and suggest common software packages.
    *   Ensure that users can still customize parameters as needed (e.g., CPU, RAM, disk size, network settings).

5.  **Improved Logging and Feedback:**
    *   Enhance logging on the frontend to provide clearer feedback to users during resource creation and management processes.
    *   Display progress indicators, success messages, and clear error messages.
    *   Ensure that logs are easily accessible and understandable for troubleshooting.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Data Structure for Templates:**
    *   Define a JSON or similar data structure to store template information, including categories, sub-categories, descriptions, icons, and default configurations.
    *   This data structure will be used to populate the template selection UI.

2.  **Frontend Component Development:**
    *   Create reusable React components for:
        *   Template cards
        *   Category filters/dropdowns
        *   Customized creation forms based on selected templates
    *   Ensure components are well-structured, maintainable, and follow best practices.

3.  **API Integration:**
    *   Update existing API calls or create new ones to fetch template data and handle creation requests based on the selected templates.
    *   Ensure backend services can process template-based creation requests and apply appropriate configurations.

4.  **UI/UX Design and Styling:**
    *   Focus on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
    *   Use clear visual hierarchy, consistent styling, and responsive design principles.
    *   Ensure the new UI elements integrate seamlessly with the existing frontend design.

5.  **Testing:**
    *   Thoroughly test the new template selection and creation process.
    *   Verify that all categories and templates are displayed correctly.
    *   Test resource creation with different templates and configurations.
    *   Ensure error handling and feedback mechanisms are working as expected.

**Example Workflow:**

1.  User navigates to the "Create Resource" page.
2.  User sees a categorized list or grid of available templates (e.g., Networking, Virtual Machines, Containers, Clusters).
3.  User can filter templates by category/subcategory using dropdowns or tabs.
4.  User clicks on a specific template card (e.g., "Ubuntu Desktop VM").
5.  A creation form appears, pre-filled with default values from the selected template (e.g., OS type, recommended CPU/RAM).
6.  User can customize parameters if needed (e.g., increase RAM, change disk size).
7.  User submits the form, and the backend provisions the resource based on the template and user customizations.
8.  User receives clear feedback on the provisioning process and success/failure status.

By implementing these enhancements, the Proxmox PaaS system will become more user-friendly, allowing users to quickly and easily create various types of resources based on predefined, well-structured templates.
